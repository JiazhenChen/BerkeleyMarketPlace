Feature: login and authentication 

  As a superuser,
  I want to manage all people's posts
  I can delete any post I want
  
Scenario: normal user cannot access admin page
  When I go to the home page
  Then I login with correct normal email
  Given there is an item
  Then I should not see "Admin"
#   Then I go to the admin page
#   Then I should not see "Statistics"
#   And I should see "not allowed to access"

Scenario: superuser can see admin page
  When I go to the home page
  Then I login with correct superuser email
  Given there is an item
#   Then I should not see "Admin"
  Then I go to the admin page
  Then I should see "Statistics"

# Scenario: superuser can delete post
#   When I go to the home page
#   Then I login with correct superuser email
#   Given there is an item
#   Then I go to the details page for "sample item title"
#   Then I press "Remove by Admin"
#   Then I should see "removed from the database"
